      That is, algebra is described as an area in mathematics that uses
      variables, in the forms of letters and symbols, to act as numbers or
      quantities in equations and formulas. Geometry, on the other hand, is
      described as an area in mathematics that studies points, lines,
      varied-dimensional objects and shapes, surfaces, and solids.

        <h1>Algebra</h1>
        
        <p>Algebra is<strong> a branch of mathematics</strong> dealing with symbols and the rules for manipulating those
            symbols. In elementary algebra, those symbols (today written as Latin and Greek letters) represent quantities
            without fixed values, known as variables.

        <h2>History of the Algebra</h2>

            alt="Ancient Egypt">
        <p>The word <em>"algebra"</em> is derived from the Arabic word الجبر al-jabr, and this comes from the treatise written
            in the year 830 by the medieval Persian mathematician, Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, whose Arabic title, Kitāb
            al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala, can be translated as The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion
            and Balancing. The treatise provided for the systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations. According to one
            history, "[i]t is not certain just what the terms al-jabr and muqabalah mean, but the usual interpretation is
            similar to that implied in the previous translation. The word 'al-jabr' presumably meant something like
            'restoration' or 'completion' and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an
            equation; the word 'muqabalah' is said to refer to 'reduction' or 'balancing'—that is, the cancellation of like
            terms on opposite sides of the equation. Arabic influence in Spain long after the time of al-Khwarizmi is found in
            Don Quixote, where the word 'algebrista' is used for a bone-setter, that is, a 'restorer'."[1] The term is used by
            al-Khwarizmi to describe the operations that he introduced, "reduction" and "balancing", referring to the
            transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on
            opposite sides of the equation.[2]</p>
        <p>Algebra can essentially be considered as doing computations similar to those of arithmetic but with non-numerical
            mathematical objects. However, until the 19th century, algebra consisted essentially of the theory of equations. For
            example, the fundamental theorem of algebra belongs to the theory of equations and is not, nowadays, considered as
            belonging to algebra (in fact, every proof must use the completeness of the real numbers, which is not an algebraic
            property).
        
            This article describes the history of the theory of equations, called here "algebra", from the origins to the
            emergence of algebra as a separate area of mathematics.</p>

            alt="triangles theorem" <p>geometry, the branch of mathematics concerned with the shape of individual objects,
        spatial relationships among various objects, and the properties of surrounding space. It is one of the oldest branches
        of mathematics, having arisen in response to such practical problems as those found in surveying, and its name is
        derived from Greek words meaning “Earth measurement.” Eventually it was realized that geometry need not be limited to
        the study of flat surfaces (plane geometry) and rigid three-dimensional objects (solid geometry) but that even the most
        abstract thoughts and images might be represented and developed in geometric terms.
        </p>
        <h2>History of the Geometry</h2>
        <p>The earliest known unambiguous examples of written records—dating from Egypt and Mesopotamia about 3100
            BCE—demonstrate that ancient peoples had already begun to devise mathematical rules and techniques useful for
            surveying land areas, constructing buildings, and measuring storage containers. Beginning about the 6th century BCE,
            the Greeks gathered and extended this practical knowledge and from it generalized the abstract subject now known as
            geometry, from the combination of the Greek words geo (“Earth”) and metron (“measure”) for the measurement of the
            Earth.</p>
